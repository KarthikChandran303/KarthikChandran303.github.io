I graduated with a degree in Computer Science, specializing in game development, in May 2023. Over the last few years, I've discovered my passion for the process of creating games and visuals, as well as connecting with people along that journey—whether through engineering gameplay or designing computer graphics. I've cataloged some of my most cherished projects here; please take a look!"
