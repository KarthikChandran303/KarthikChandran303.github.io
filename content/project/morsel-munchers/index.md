Morsel Muncher was a 2 week long project we worked on as a part of our advanced games project class. Following a pachinko-style concept, the player must control paddles to direct morsels of food into heat zones ensuring the food is cooked before it reaches the alienâ€™s mouth.

In this project I worked on:
- Designing the gameplay loop
- Creating shaders and materials: custom skybox shader, heat zone shader, peg color switch shader, and paddle shader.
- Integrating art assets into the scene
