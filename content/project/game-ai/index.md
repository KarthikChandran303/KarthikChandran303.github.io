For my final assignment of CSC 484 - Building Game AI, I created a simulation where two characters traverse an indoor environment. One character is identified as the monster and its goal is to pursue the other character, identified as the player. If the monster catches the player then the two characters return to their respective starting positions.

In this class I:

- Used C++ and the SFML library to implement AI functionality.
- Studied the design of AI characters in computer games.
- Implemented movement of AI characters using steering behaviours.
- Implemented several AI algorithms and data structures - such as A*, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, graphs (for path finding), and behavior trees, decision trees (for character decision making)
